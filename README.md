# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp - Data Analysis with Python** course.  
The task is to create a function `calculate()` that uses **NumPy** to compute basic statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum) for a 3x3 matrix.
